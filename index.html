    <h2>About the Maze Runner Project</h2>
    <div class="about-content">
        <p>
            The inspiration behind the Maze Runner project came from my fascination with puzzles and the challenge of navigating complex environments. Growing up, I enjoyed solving mazes in books, and Iâ€™ve always been intrigued by the idea of getting lost and finding a way out. The thrill of figuring out the correct path under pressure was something I wanted to bring into the digital world.
        </p>
        <p>
            When I started this project, I envisioned creating an immersive and engaging game where players could test their problem-solving skills. Over the past few months, I've poured my passion for gaming, design, and development into making this project a reality. This project also serves as a key milestone in my portfolio for Holberton School, showcasing my skills in game development, raycasting, and SDL2.
